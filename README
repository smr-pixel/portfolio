# Professional Statement 

I am deeply committed to protecting individuals and organizations through both technical solutions and sound policy. With a solid foundation in Information and Computer Science, I actively apply my skills in areas such as PowerShell security, secure coding aligned with the OWASP Top 10, and ongoing professional certification work. As the founder of the WiCyS chapter at the University of Pittsburgh, I am also dedicated to building community and educating others in cybersecurity. To approach cybersecurity from a multidisciplinary angle, I supplement my technical expertise with Global Policy studies and focused analysis of international cyber law. I aim to be a holistic asset to organizations by providing reliable technical experience, sharp communications skills, and a nuanced perspective about cybersecurity on the world stage.
